# LexStep Guidelines for both Browser and Node.js projects

## Add eslintignore

Copy the `.eslintignore` from the current directory to your project root, next to `.eslintrc.js`

## Contribution Guidelines

You should include contribution guidelines in your project.

A good boilerplate for this is [./CONTRIBUTION.md](CONTRIBUTION.md)

## Linting on Commit

See the guide on linting on commit, [here](./lint-on-commit.md)

## Project Conventions

- Generally speaking, you should keep files outside of the root directory of your project.
